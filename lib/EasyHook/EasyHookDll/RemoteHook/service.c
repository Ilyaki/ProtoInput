EASYHOOK_NT_EXPORT RtlInstallService(

            WCHAR* InExePath,

/*
Description:

    This method is intended for the managed layer only. It will
    provide a convenient way to install a service which seems to
    be impossible with NET code in any efficient manner.
    
Parameters:

    - InServiceName

        A unique service name under which the service shall be registered.
        In case of the EasyHook service, this value is expected to be exactly
        the filename without extension of the full "InExePath".

    - InExePath

        A relative or absolute path to the service EXE file.

    - InChannelName

        The channel name for the service to register its IPC channel.
        This should be randomly generated.

Returns:

    STATUS_ALREADY_REGISTERED

        A service with this name is already registered. To prevent name collisions
        I recommend to rename the service to an unique name for your specific
        application. Please refer to the README file for more information.

    STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED

        You are not administrator?!
