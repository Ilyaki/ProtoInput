NOTE:

When updating OpenXinput, remember to make these modifications so it works with Proto Input:
- rename DllMain to OpenXinputDllMain
- rename the exported functions in OpenXinput.cpp and OpenXinput.h from XInput to OpenXInput (e.g. XInputGetState to OpenXInputGetState)
- set OPENXINPUT_XUSER_MAX_COUNT to 64 (instead of 4)
